## Signing Documents

### Prerequisites

Before signing, you need:
1. **Certificate**: Your X.509 certificate (PEM format)
2. **Private Key**: Corresponding private key (PEM format)
3. **Document**: The file you want to sign

### Step-by-Step Signing Process

#### Step 1: Upload Certificate

1. Go to the **Sign** page
2. In the "Certificate" section, upload your certificate
3. Verify the certificate details are correct
4. Check that the certificate is valid (not expired)

#### Step 2: Upload Private Key

1. In the "Private Key" section, upload your private key
2. If the key is encrypted, enter the password
3. The application will verify the key matches the certificate
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note**: Your private key never leaves your browser

#### Step 3: Upload Document

1. In the "Document" section, upload the file to sign
2. Supported file types: Any file up to 50MB
3. The application will calculate the document hash
4. Review the document information:
   - File name
   - File size
   - SHA-256 hash

#### Step 4: Configure Signature Options

Choose your signature settings:

**Hash Algorithm**
- **SHA-256** (Recommended): Most widely supported
- **SHA-384**: Higher security, larger signatures
- **SHA-512**: Maximum security, largest signatures

**Signature Format**
- **PKCS#7**: Standard format, includes certificate
- **Detached**: Separate signature file, smaller size

**Additional Options**
- **Include Timestamp**: Add trusted timestamp (requires TSA)
- **Output Format**: Base64 (text) or Binary

#### Step 5: Generate Signature

1. Review all settings
2. Click **Sign Document**
3. Wait for signature generation (usually < 1 second)
4. The signature will be displayed

#### Step 6: Download Signature

1. Review the signature details
2. Click **Download Signature** to save the file
3. Or click **Copy to Clipboard** to copy the signature
4. The signature file will be named: `[document-name].sig`

### Signature File Formats

**PKCS#7 Format**
```
-----BEGIN PKCS7-----
MIIGPQYJKoZIhvcNAQcCoIIGLjCCBioCAQExDzANBglghkgBZQMEAgEFADALBgkq
...
-----END PKCS7-----
```

**Detached Signature**
- Binary file containing only the signature
- Requires original document for verification
- Smaller file size

## Validating Signatures

### Prerequisites

To validate a signature, you need:
1. **Original Document**: The signed file (unchanged)
2. **Signature File**: The .sig or PKCS#7 file
3. **CA Certificates** (Optional): Trusted root certificates

### Step-by-Step Validation Process

#### Step 1: Upload Document

1. Go to the **Validate** page
2. Upload the original document
3. Ensure it's the exact same file that was signed
4. Any modification will cause validation to fail

#### Step 2: Upload Signature

1. Upload the signature file (.sig or .p7s)
2. The application will parse the signature
3. It will extract the signer's certificate

#### Step 3: Upload CA Certificates (Optional)

1. If you want to verify the certificate chain:
2. Upload trusted CA certificates
3. You can upload multiple CA certificates
4. This validates the signer's certificate is trusted

#### Step 4: Validate

1. Click **Validate Signature**
2. The application will perform multiple checks:
   - Signature cryptographic validity
   - Document integrity (hash match)
   - Certificate validity (not expired)
   - Certificate chain (if CAs provided)
   - Timestamp validity (if present)

### Validation Results

#### ‚úÖ Valid Signature

All checks passed:
- ‚úì Signature is cryptographically valid
- ‚úì Document has not been modified
- ‚úì Certificate is valid
- ‚úì Certificate chain is trusted (if verified)

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Valid with Warnings

Signature is valid but has warnings:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Certificate is expired (but was valid when signed)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Certificate chain cannot be verified
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Weak hash algorithm used

#### ‚ùå Invalid Signature

Validation failed:
- ‚ùå Signature does not match document
- ‚ùå Document has been modified
- ‚ùå Certificate is invalid
- ‚ùå Cryptographic verification failed

### Understanding Validation Details

## Understanding Results

### Certificate Status Indicators

| Indicator | Meaning | Action |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| üü¢ Valid | Certificate is currently valid | Safe to use |
| üü° Expiring Soon | Less than 30 days until expiration | Renew soon |

## Troubleshooting

### Certificate Upload Issues

**"Invalid certificate format"**
- Ensure file is in PEM, DER, or CRT format
- Check file is not corrupted
- Try converting to PEM format

**"Cannot parse certificate"**
- File may be encrypted
- File may be a certificate request (CSR) not a certificate
- Verify file contains a valid X.509 certificate

### Signing Issues

**"Private key does not match certificate"**
- Ensure you're using the correct private key
- Key and certificate must be a pair
- Check if key is encrypted and password is correct

**"Failed to generate signature"**
- Check private key is valid
- Ensure document is not corrupted
- Try with a smaller document

**"Document too large"**
- Maximum file size is 50MB
- Split large files or compress
- Use detached signature format

### Validation Issues

**"Signature verification failed"**
- Document may have been modified
- Signature file may be corrupted
- Ensure using correct document and signature pair

**"Hash mismatch"**
- Document has been modified after signing
- Using wrong document file
- Document encoding may have changed

## Best Practices

### Certificate Management

1. **Keep Certificates Secure**
   - Store in encrypted location
   - Limit access to authorized users
   - Back up certificates regularly

2. **Monitor Expiration**
   - Check expiration dates regularly
   - Renew certificates before expiration
   - Set up expiration reminders

3. **Use Strong Keys**
   - Minimum 2048-bit RSA keys
   - Prefer 4096-bit for long-term use
   - Consider ECDSA for better performance

### Signing Documents

1. **Choose Appropriate Algorithm**
   - Use SHA-256 or higher
   - Avoid SHA-1 and MD5
   - Consider SHA-512 for sensitive documents

2. **Protect Private Keys**
   - Never share private keys
   - Use encrypted keys with strong passwords
   - Clear browser cache after use

3. **Include Timestamps**
   - Proves when document was signed
   - Validates signature even after certificate expires
   - Use trusted timestamp authorities

4. **Document Integrity**
   - Sign final versions only
   - Don't modify documents after signing
   - Keep original and signed copies

### Validation

1. **Verify Complete Chain**
   - Always provide CA certificates
   - Verify chain to trusted root
   - Check for revocation (CRL/OCSP)

2. **Check All Details**
   - Review signer identity
   - Verify signature timestamp
   - Check certificate validity period

3. **Keep Records**
   - Save validation reports
   - Document validation date
   - Store with signed documents

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Is my data secure?**
A: Yes! All operations happen in your browser. No data is transmitted to any server.

**Q: Do I need to install anything?**
A: No, it's a web application. Just use a modern browser.

**Q: Can I use this offline?**
A: After initial load, most features work offline. Timestamp validation requires internet.

### Certificate Questions

**Q: What certificate formats are supported?**
A: PEM (.pem, .crt, .cer), DER (.der), and Base64 encoded certificates.

**Q: Can I use self-signed certificates?**
A: Yes, but they won't have a trusted chain unless you provide the CA certificate.

**Q: How do I get a certificate?**
A: From a Certificate Authority (CA) like Let's Encrypt, DigiCert, or create self-signed for testing.

### Signing Questions

**Q: What file types can I sign?**
A: Any file type up to 50MB.

**Q: Can I sign multiple documents at once?**
A: Currently no, sign documents one at a time.

**Q: Is the signature legally binding?**
A: Depends on jurisdiction. Consult legal counsel for your specific use case.

### Validation Questions

**Q: Can I validate old signatures?**
A: Yes, if the certificate was valid when signed and you have the original document.

**Q: What if validation shows warnings?**
A: Review the warnings. Some (like expired certificates) may be acceptable if signed before expiration.

**Q: Can I validate signatures created by other tools?**
A: Yes, if they use standard PKCS#7 format.
